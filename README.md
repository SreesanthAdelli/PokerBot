# PokerBot
This repository provides an interactive poker interface that allows users to play against a poker bot powered by OpenAI GPT-4. The bot uses advanced natural language processing and strategic decision-making to simulate human-like poker play. The goal of this project is to create a challenging and dynamic poker experience with AI-driven gameplay.
